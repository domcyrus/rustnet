Description: Cross-platform network monitoring terminal UI tool
 RustNet provides real-time visibility into network connections with
 detailed state information, connection lifecycle management, deep
 packet inspection, and a terminal user interface.
 .
 Features include:
  * Real-time Network Monitoring for TCP, UDP, ICMP, and ARP connections
  * Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) for HTTP/HTTPS, DNS, SSH, and QUIC protocols
  * Connection lifecycle management with protocol-aware timeouts
  * Process identification and service name resolution
  * Cross-platform support (Linux, macOS, Windows, BSD)
  * Advanced filtering with vim/fzf-style search
  * Multi-threaded processing for optimal performance
  * eBPF-enhanced process detection (enabled by default with automatic fallback)
